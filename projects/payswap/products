# Games
"Picture this: Jack is an avid fan of Call of Duty. Now imagine a revolutionary platform that allows Jack to earn money simply by playing his favorite game. Here's how it works: before diving into each gaming session, Jack hires a game auditor from the platform to monitor his gameplay. He then purchases 30 minutes of Call of Duty time directly from the platform and kicks off his gaming session. At the conclusion of the purchased 30 minutes, the auditor records Jack's score and submits it to the platform. If Jack's score surpasses a certain threshold relative to other players' scores, he earns money.

The beauty of this system is that the more players participate, the greater the pool of money available for distribution, thereby increasing Jack's earning potential. This groundbreaking opportunity isn't available anywhere else today, but you can embark on this journey by playing your games on PaySwap. Join the vibrant community of players on PaySwap and together, let's transform this dream into reality."

# Bottegas
"Free tokens serve as the financial backbone for institutions dedicated to cultivating a world of abundance known as Bottegas, which are non-profit entities. A Bottegas embodies the fusion of a university and a company, envisioning a vast educational institution equipped with multiple factories and laboratories. These entities focus on addressing the specific needs of their communities across various utility sectors. PaySwap's overarching objective is to utilize free tokens to support the establishment and operations of numerous Bottegas worldwide.

The ultimate aim is to proliferate Bottegas globally to ensure that every individual on the planet has access to an ample supply of each of the 12 PaySwap utilities, enabling them to lead comfortable lives."

# Proof of value
"PaySwap employs a unique mechanism known as Proof of Value to mint its free tokens. At the conclusion of each week, the platform's free token minter calculates the total tokens expended within the marketplace for each free token. It then deducts the total tokens spent at the end of the previous week from this figure and generates the difference as new tokens. For example, consider the Free Energy Token (FET): if 1 million FET were spent at the end of the previous week and 2 million FET have been expended by the current week's end, then the platform would mint 1 million FET tokens for the current week.

Notably, 99% of all newly minted tokens are allocated to businesses, contributors, and referrers active on the platform. For further insights into token emissions and distributions, we encourage you to consult the PaySwap documentation for comprehensive details."

# Free Tokens
"Payswap introduces 12 tokens aptly named 'free tokens,' each representing a vital utility essential for a rich and comfortable life. The goal of these tokens is to ensure the abundance of each utility to the extent that it becomes entirely free, hence the name 'free token.' According to Payswap, every individual deserves abundant access to these 12 specific utilities: Law & Order, Beverage, Food, Energy, Transportation, Healthcare, Technology, Entertainment, Apparel & Beauty products, Real Estate, Minerals, and NSFW products. To delve deeper into how these free tokens are minted and their role in making these utilities freely accessible, we invite you to explore our other informative videos."
